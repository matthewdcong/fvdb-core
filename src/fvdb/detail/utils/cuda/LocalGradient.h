/// @brief Create an owning, zeroed CUDA gradient with tensor's dtype and optional camera compaction.
/// Flatten pads contiguous, flattened storage to equally sized element shards. Otherwise,
/// pad the Gaussian dimension of each camera in [C, N, ...] to equally sized Gaussian shards;
/// camera strides include this padding and must be honored by kernels. numLocalCameras optionally
/// limits the camera dimension; storage after the logical tensor holds this device's Gaussian
/// shards for the remaining cameras. Those shards use the logical (unpadded) device shard size.
/// The tail is ordered by global camera ID, omitting the contiguous local camera range. With
/// no local cameras the logical tensor is empty, but its storage can still hold receive shards.
/// Use the same Flatten value and camera offsets for reduction and output copies.
/// @note The caller must select deviceId and supply a stream on that device. Allocation, zeroing,
/// and freeing use the supplied stream; all uses of the tensor must be ordered before its free on
/// that stream. The last tensor owner must be released while the stream is still valid.
/// Freeing the allocation leaves deviceId current; callers must select their device for later work.
/// CUDA API calls are checked for errors.
